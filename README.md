# Party Form Project

This project contains a simple party registration form with validation, designed with React.

## Features
- A form that collects user information (name, email, and phone number).
- Basic form validation for all fields.
- Responsive design to adapt to various screen sizes.
- Background image and styling to make the page visually appealing.

## Current Issues
Currently, there is a known issue with the design: the elements (especially the image and content) are not properly aligned on screen widths below 700px. I am working on fixing this issue to ensure that the layout remains consistent and functional across all screen sizes.

## Planned Fixes
- Resolve the layout issue where the image and content are misaligned after 700px width.
- Ensure that all elements are responsive and scale appropriately without breaking the design.

## How to Run
To run the project locally:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application with `npm run dev`.
